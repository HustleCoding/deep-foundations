- INTRODUCTION
	- read javascript specification
	- javascript is divided into three core pillars:
		- types:
			- primitive types
			- abstract operations
			- coercion
			- equality
			- TypeScript, Flow etc.
		- scope:
			- nested scope
			- hoisting
			- closure
			- modules
		- objects:
			- this
			- class {}
			- prototypes
			- OO vs. OLOO
- TYPES
	- primitive types:
		- undefined
		- string
		- number
		- boolean
		- object
		- symbol
	- typeof operator
		- undefined vs. undeclared - starting with the emptiness
		- special values - NaN - which indicates an invalid number
			- NaN is not equal to itself (NaN != Nan)
			- -0 (negative zero)
	- coercion (aka type conversion) - Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers):
		- abstract operation:
			- ToPrimitive()
			- ToString()
